// Plan for adding sample filters to the v3 API and dashboard UI.
// Exists to document the filtering work for future reference.

Plan:
1) Expand the api_v3 sample filter set and add a filter-options endpoint aligned with legacy SampleFilter fields.
2) Add the Next.js dashboard proxy for filter options and pass filter query params to the samples fetch.
3) Build a minimal filters UI in the samples dashboard with clear/apply controls.
