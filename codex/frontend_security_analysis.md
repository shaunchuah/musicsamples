# Frontend Authentication Security Analysis

## Current Authentication Architecture

The frontend uses a Next.js application with middleware-based route protection, storing authentication tokens in HTTP-only cookies. Login/logout operations are handled through Next.js API routes that proxy to Django's REST Framework token authentication.

## Security Strengths

âœ… **HTTP-Only Cookies**: The `authToken` is stored in an HTTP-only cookie, preventing XSS attacks from accessing the token via JavaScript.

âœ… **Secure Cookie Configuration**:

- `secure` flag set in production
- `sameSite: "lax"` provides CSRF protection
- 8-hour expiration prevents long-lived sessions

âœ… **Proper CORS Setup**:

- Specific allowed origins (`localhost:3000`, production domains)
- `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True` for cookie transmission

âœ… **CSRF Protection**: Django's CSRF middleware is enabled

âœ… **Token-Based Auth**: Uses Django REST Framework's token authentication

## Security Issues and Recommendations

### ðŸ”´ **Critical: No Authenticated API Calls**

The frontend currently only handles login/logout but doesn't make authenticated requests to the backend. When implemented, you'll need to decide how to transmit the token:

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: Proxy all API calls through Next.js API routes

```typescript
// In /app/api/data/route.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const token = request.cookies.get('authToken')?.value;
  const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/data`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Token ${token}` }
  });
  return response;
}
```

**Option 2**: Use server components for data fetching (Next.js 13+ app router)

**Option 3 (Not Recommended)**: Make cookies accessible to client-side JavaScript (removes XSS protection)

### ðŸŸ¡ **Token Expiration Handling**

- Tokens expire after 8 hours but there's no automatic refresh mechanism
- Users will be abruptly logged out
- Consider implementing token refresh or extending expiration

### ðŸŸ¡ **No Rate Limiting**

- No visible rate limiting on login attempts
- Vulnerable to brute force attacks
- Add rate limiting middleware or use Django's built-in throttling

### ðŸŸ¡ **Mixed Authentication Methods**

The backend supports JWT, session, and token auth simultaneously. This could lead to confusion and potential security gaps. Consider standardizing on one method.

### ðŸŸ¡ **Token Storage**

Using DRF's `Token` model which creates persistent tokens. While the cookie expires, the token itself remains valid until manually deleted.

### ðŸŸ¢ **Password Security**

- Standard Django password validators are configured
- No immediate concerns

## Overall Assessment

The authentication setup is **reasonably secure** for a basic application, with good protection against common attacks like XSS and CSRF. However, the main concern is the incomplete implementation - the frontend doesn't yet make authenticated API calls, which is where most security issues would manifest.

**Priority Actions:**

1. Implement secure token transmission for API calls (prefer server-side proxying)
2. Add rate limiting to login endpoints
3. Consider token refresh mechanism
4. Audit when real API integration begins

The setup follows security best practices where implemented, but needs completion for production use.
